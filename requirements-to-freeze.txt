# We don't need importlib-metadata at the top-level.  However, it's pulled in
# by Flake8, and on Python 3.7, there's a version conflict:
#   ERROR: Cannot install flake8==4.0.1 and importlib-metadata==4.6.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
#
#   ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#fixing-conflicting-dependencies
#   The conflict is caused by:
#       The user requested importlib-metadata==4.6.1
#       flake8 4.0.1 depends on importlib-metadata<4.3; python_version < "3.8"
#
#   To fix this you could try to:
#   1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
#   2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
#
#   Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
importlib-metadata<4.3
