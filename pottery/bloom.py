class BloomFilter(BloomFilterABC, Container):
    '''Redis-backed Bloom filter with an API similar to Python sets.

    Bloom filters are a powerful data structure that help you to answer the
    question, "Have I seen this element before?" but not the question, "What
    are all of the elements that I've seen before?"  So think of Bloom filters
    as Python sets that you can add elements to and use to test element
    membership, but that you can't iterate through or get elements back out of.

    Bloom filters are probabilistic, which means that they can sometimes
    generate false positives (as in, they may report that you've seen a
    particular element before even though you haven't).  But they will never
    generate false negatives (so every time that they report that you haven't
    seen a particular element before, you really must never have seen it).  You
    can tune your acceptable false positive probability, though at the expense
    of the storage size and the element insertion/lookup time of your Bloom
    filter.

    Wikipedia article:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter

    Reference implementation:
        http://www.maxburstein.com/blog/creating-a-simple-bloom-filter/

    Instantiate a Bloom filter and clean up Redis before the doctest:

        >>> dilberts = BloomFilter(
        ...     num_elements=100,
        ...     false_positives=0.01,
        ...     key='dilberts',
        ... )
        >>> dilberts.clear()

    Here, num_elements represents the number of elements that you expect to
    insert into your BloomFilter, and false_positives represents your
    acceptable false positive probability.  Using these two parameters,
    BloomFilter automatically computes its own storage size and number of times
    to run its hash functions on element insertion/lookup such that it can
    guarantee a false positive rate at or below what you can tolerate, given
    that you're going to insert your specified number of elements.

    Insert an element into the Bloom filter:

        >>> dilberts.add('rajiv')

    Test for element membership in the Bloom filter:

        >>> 'rajiv' in dilberts
        True
        >>> 'raj' in dilberts
        False
        >>> 'dan' in dilberts
        False

    See how many elements we've inserted into the Bloom filter:

        >>> len(dilberts)
        1

    Note that BloomFilter.__len__() is an approximation, not an exact value,
    though it's quite accurate.

    Insert multiple elements into the Bloom filter:

        >>> dilberts.update({'raj', 'dan'})
        >>> len(dilberts)
        3

    Remove all of the elements from the Bloom filter:

        >>> dilberts.clear()
    '''

    def _bit_offsets(self, value: JSONTypes) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
        '''The bit offsets to set/check in this Bloom filter for a given value.

        Instantiate a Bloom filter:

            >>> dilberts = BloomFilter(
            ...     num_elements=100,
            ...     false_positives=0.01,
            ...     key='dilberts',
            ... )

        Now let's look at a few examples:

            >>> tuple(dilberts._bit_offsets('rajiv'))
            (183, 319, 787, 585, 8, 471, 711)
            >>> tuple(dilberts._bit_offsets('raj'))
            (482, 875, 725, 667, 109, 714, 595)
            >>> tuple(dilberts._bit_offsets('dan'))
            (687, 925, 954, 707, 615, 914, 620)

        Thus, if we want to insert the value 'rajiv' into our Bloom filter,
        then we must set bits 183, 319, 787, 585, 8, 471, and 711 all to 1.  If
        any/all of them are already 1, no problems.

        Similarly, if we want to check to see if the value 'rajiv' is in our
        Bloom filter, then we must check to see if the bits 183, 319, 787, 585,
        8, 471, and 711 are all set to 1.  If even one of those bits is set to
        0, then the value 'rajiv' must never have been inserted into our Bloom
        filter.  But if all of those bits are set to 1, then the value 'rajiv'
        has *probably* been inserted into our Bloom filter.
